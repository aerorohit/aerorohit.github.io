 In the mainstream CFD, mostly, mesh-based methods are used. Such methods are widely used in the engineering community. But these methods have some drawbacks as generating meshes is a bit cumbersome work and mainly affects the performance of your simulation results. In this regard, meshless approaches are more convenient. 

There are multiple ways to simulate using particle methods, and I will be talking about the Vortex Blob method for 2D problems. In which, we have particles (or blobs) that have vorticity, and they interact in a way so as to simulate the real fluid flow.
## Getting Started
Everything starts with our good old friend Navier Stokes Equation. Just to refresh your memory it is..

$$
\rho \frac{\partial\bar{v}}{\partial t} + \rho (\bar{v}\cdot\nabla) \bar{v} = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \bar{v}
$$

We have neglected gravity here. And as we are using the vortex blob method, we need to represent this in the form of vorticity and velocity. After taking the curl of the  NS equation we get-

$$
\underbrace{\frac{D\bar{\omega}}{Dt}}_{advection} =\underbrace{\bar{\omega}\nabla{\bar{v}}}_{stretching} - \underbrace{\nu\nabla^2 \bar{\omega}}_{diffusion}
$$

As mentioned below each term, the first term is an advection term second one is for vorticity stretching, and the third one is for diffusion. Also, for 2D problems, vorticity stretching is zero. Now for simplicity, if we consider an inviscid case, then we have to solve  $$ \frac{D\bar{\omega}}{Dt} =0 $$ on the given domain.Now, if we discretize the vorticity on the domain using particles, then we can simulate inviscid flow. Still, there is a problem with how do we find the velocity of each particle given the vorticity field. Without getting into the mathematics, I would directly state here.

$$
(u, v) = k_\delta * \omega
$$

here $$k_\delta$$ is called kernel. It depends on boundary conditions in the flow under consideration. For point vortex with no boundaries kernel is 
$$
\frac{1}{2\pi r^2}(-y, x)
$$

Now for a system of N particles, the velocity of the ith particle is given by representing convolution integral by summation.
